## About

My personal website for showcasing my software development portfolio. Currently a work-in-progress but is mostly complete.

## How I built it

I created this website using Vite, React, and Nodejs. Additionally, I deployed my site to the web using Netlify and my custom domain.

## Challenges I ran into

- Making sure client-side routing works on page refresh and manually typed urls
- Deploying and configuring my website with a custom domain
- Using a suitable color palette for both light and dark mode

## What I Learned

- Basics of CI/CD with Github Actions
- Animating page transitions and components in React with Framer Motion
- Configuring Custom domains with Netlify

## What's next

- Integrating Github API or webhooks to load project data
- Creating an API to fetch portfolio data
- Adding a work experience section (once I get relevant work experience ðŸ˜…)
